# Recent grad from Arizona State University looking for work in software development for robotics or automation applications! 

My goal is to work on mobile robotics for plantary exploration, be it the most exotic places on earth or among the stars. I prefer python but I'm comfortable using MATLAB or C++ when necessary. I am predominantly self-taugh in programming but continually improving myself as a developer. Due to my start in Physics and grad school in Robotics I'm very comfortable with high level concepts and using advanced mathematics in problem solving and computer science. While I am still very capable and quick to learn in programming, my strengths currently lie in high level problems solving and my interdisciplinary knowledge.
