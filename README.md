Recent grad from Arizona State University looking for work in software development for robotics or automation applications! I prefer python but I'm comfortable using MATLAB or C++ when necessary. I am predominantly self-taugh in programming 
but continually improving myself as a developer. Due to my start in Physics and grad school in Robotics I'm very comfortable with high level concepts and using advanced mathematics in problem solving and computer science. While I am still very capable and quick to
learn in programming, my strengths currently lie in high level problems solving and my interdisciplinary knowledge.
